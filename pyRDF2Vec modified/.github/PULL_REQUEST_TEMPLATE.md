# Pull Request Check List

This is just a friendly reminder about the most common mistakes. Please make
sure that you tick all boxes. But please read our [contribution
guide](https://pyrdf2vec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html) at least
once, it will save you unnecessary review cycles!

If an item doesn't apply to your pull request, **check it anyway** to make it
apparent that there's nothing left to do.  If your pull request is a
documentation fix or a trivial typo, feel free to delete the whole thing.

For this pull request:
- [ ] I added **tests** for changed code.
- [ ] I updated **documentation** for changed code.
- [ ] I wrote the documentation as `.rst` files and using [semantic
      newlines](https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/).

If you have *any* questions to *any* of the points above, just **submit and
ask**! This checklist is here to *help* you, not to deter you from contributing!
